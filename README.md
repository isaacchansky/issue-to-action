#The Challenge
##Using Technology To Better Identify Civic Problems

How can technology empower young change-makers to choose a high-impact focus issue?
No group of citizens can solve all the worldâ€™s problems, so it is critical for change-makers to focus their efforts. As our young people embark on their change-making with Generation Citizen, they want to know how best to focus their time and talent. How can technology help our students identify the biggest problems affecting young people in their community? How can technology help our students identify the key issues, which, if addressed, would have the biggest impact on their lives as Boston community members?

#Our Solution
We focused on the above challenge, and came up with a tool aimed to simply and quickly help citizens form a critical mass of passionate individuals around an issue. 

##*Issue to Action*

*Issue to Action* was built directly from our findings when talking to students & how they get involved with issues in their community. We found that an individual goes through following process:

1. Identify an issue 'close to home': **"I think the MBTA fares are too high. As a student, I can't afford to get to school"**
2. Find others who share the same issue: **"Who else thinks this is a problem? Is it just me?"**
3. Gain confidence & validate your internal issue by seeing it as a problem in the community: **"Lots of people share my problem"**
4. Learn about the issue (pros, cons of solutions) 
5. brainstorm solutions
6. vote or otherwise come to a consensus
7. take action
8. iterate

We focused on these first three steps. 

The *Issue to Action* website allows a citien a simple clean interface to **submit an issue** - there is no joining, signing, or pre-validation. Just say what is wrong. Think of this closer to a twitter post than a form submission.

Once one submits an issue, they are shown all the other users who have aired similar concers, or had the same problem. Now we have a community. Now we can make change.

From here, we plan to treat the platform as a launching point to drive individuals to various calls to action. If your issue is local, start or join a Meetup Group around it. If it is national, call or write a representative. If it is global, sign a petition. We also plan to integrate with several platforms to educate individuals about both sides of an issue. We want to bring like-mined individuals together, but want to be self-aware and wary of "silos" and "groupthink".
